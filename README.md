[![Build Status: Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/sparkeh9/coreftp?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/sparkeh9/coreftp?branch=master&svg=true)

CoreFTP is a simple .NET FTP library written entirely in C#, it is targeted at netstandard 1.6, meaning it will run under .NET Core (which is also where it derives its name) and the full .NET framework.
This package was inspired due to a lack of packages providing FTP functionality compiled with support for the netstandard API surface.

NuGet page is at: https://www.nuget.org/packages/CoreFtp/

### .NET Framework compatability ###
CoreFTP Supports and includes compiled binaries for:
- NetStandard 1.6 and above
- .NET Framework 4.5.2 and above


### Usage ###
Usage of this small library was intended to be as simple as possible. The integration test suite provides various example of basic FTP usage.

#### Connecting to an FTP/S server ####
Connecting to FTP/s supports both Explicit and Implicit modes.
```cs
var cfg = new FtpClientConfiguration
{
    Host = "localhost",
    Username = "user",
    Password = "password",
    Port = 990,
    EncryptionType = FtpEncryption.Implicit,
    IgnoreCertificateErrors = true
};
using var ftpClient = new FtpClient(cfg);
await ftpClient.LoginAsync();
```

#### Downloading a file to a filestream on local disk ####

```cs
var cfg = new FtpClientConfiguration
{
    Host = "localhost",
    Username = "user",
    Password = "password"
};
using var ftpClient = new FtpClient(cfg);
var tempFile = new FileInfo(@"C:\test.png");
await ftpClient.LoginAsync();
using var ftpReadStream = await ftpClient.OpenFileReadStreamAsync("test.png");
using var fileWriteStream = tempFile.OpenWrite();
await ftpReadStream.CopyToAsync(fileWriteStream);
```

#### Uploading from a local filestream to the FTP server ####

```cs
var cfg = new FtpClientConfiguration
{
    Host = "localhost",
    Username = "user",
    Password = "password"
};
using var ftpClient = new FtpClient(cfg);
var fileinfo = new FileInfo(@"C:\test.png");
await ftpClient.LoginAsync();    

using var writeStream = await ftpClient.OpenFileWriteStreamAsync("test.png");
var fileReadStream = fileinfo.OpenRead();
await fileReadStream.CopyToAsync(writeStream);
```

### Integration Tests ###
Integration tests can be run against most FTP servers with passive mode enabled, credentials can be configured in appsettings.json of CoreFtp.Tests.Integration.
